Hi Gabriela!
 
I hope you're having a great week so far! 
I connected with you a few months ago and since then, I've seen quite a few posts from you about Vimeo's internship program and was just wondering if you'd be willing to answer some questions I've got about Vimeo Internship positions.
I applied online for the internship positions that opened just recently, however I am quite interested in finding out more about the kind of projects interns have worked on during their internships at Vimeo in the past.
Are interns typically integrated directly into the work of a team they're placed on (basically doing the same work a FTE does) or do they get assigned to separate projects and work on these over the summer under the guidance of a mentor?


Thanks a ton,
Nikolay Pomytkin
