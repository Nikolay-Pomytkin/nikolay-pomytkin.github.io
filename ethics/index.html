              <b>What’s the most fun thing you’ve done so far this year?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the winter break, I went to Texas to visit my older sister (who lives/works in Austin) and we went on
              a road trip exploring different parts of Texas and New Mexico. I think one of the best (and most fun) parts
              of that experience was visiting the Carlsbad caverns (in NM). The Carlsbad Caverns are really complex, featuring
              over 100 different caves, and it was really interesting to see the kinds of ancient formations that you can see throughout
              the caves (stalactites and stalagmites). 
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Can you describe a time when you worked your hardest? What happened?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <u>HackRU Spring 2019:</u> (hackathon at Rutgers University) <br/>
              2 of my friends and I formed a group to work on a health-focused project. When we first started out, we weren't 
              really sure about what exactly we would make, but as we brainstormed some ideas as a group, we figured out an idea that
              we all wanted to work on. Throughout the course of the 24 hour event, the three of us worked really hard to get a working prototype.
              All 3 of us built upon each other's strengths, splitting up the work by figuring out who was the most experienced with certain 
              technologies and worked to bring different parts of the project together. In the end, we had a working project that ended up getting 
              the overall 1st place, as well as the "Best AI/ML Hack" superlative. Although we didn't get too much sleep and it definitely took a toll
              on us, it felt really good to have our hard work rewarded with a prize, and to make such a technically-complicated project.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>What issues or ideas make your heart beat faster, whether because you are so deeply compelled by them, because you are angered by them, or because you are overjoyed by them?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the issues that I'm really passionate/concerned about is the rise of automation and the growing wealth gap in the United States. In recent years,
              there has been a trend of replacing certain blue collar work with robotic machinery. Employment in the U.S. manufacturing industry has gone down consistently
              over the past decade, as well as in retail. Working class people are losing their jobs. Wage growth is stagnating. Many families can't afford to pay
              an unexpected bill. While all this happens, the 1% continue to grow their wealth. Despite America being one of the wealthiest countries in the world,
              our poverty levels are equal to or above many other developed nations. In 2019, the top 20% of families earned 52% of the nation's income, almost 10% more than
              in 1960 (43%) <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/02/07/6-facts-about-economic-inequality-in-the-u-s/">(Schaeffer)</a>. We must start to think about what kinds of sweeping policies could help reverse
              this trend and help reduce the stark income inequality in our nation.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>What do you enjoy talking to people about?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              There's a lot of different topics that I like to talk to people about. Often, I try to find something that we share in common and focus on that during a 
              conversation. Sometimes that leads to a deep conversation on one specific topic, which really helps build a connection with the other person. Also, I often 
              find myself talking to people about music, movies, TV shows, hobbies, and other things that people often define their identity by. 
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
              <b>What would your friends ask for your help on?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              A lot of the time it is school or career related, but I find that my closest friends ask me for help regarding personal issues that they face in their lives (that's
              how you can really tell the difference between your closest friends and just "people in your friend group"). Sometimes when a friend asks me for help on an issue 
              like that, all they're looking for is support and encouragement, but at other times they're really looking for support. It is important to be able to make the 
              distinction between those two and properly address your friends needs. You have to be there for your friends when they need you, so that they'll be there for you
              when you need them.

                This was actually the first lecture of ENEE200 that I attended, since I joined the class late off of the waitlist. For me, this lecture was a great intro to 
                the course. I remember what happened during this lecture pretty clearly, even when writing about it weeks later. I remember it being a bit awkward at first, because
                I wasn't sure what lecture group I was in. For the first few minutes of lecture I aimlessly walked around trying to figure out what group I was supposed to be with,
                until finally approaching Dr. Mogul and getting placed with the group that I ended up working with for the first quarter of the semester. We were introduced to the first
                ethical framework of the semester: ABET and "the Good Engineer". This was my first introduction to the idea of ethical frameworks in this class, and it was genuinely
                the first example (of many throughout the course) of concepts that change the way I thought about engineering. 
                <br/> <br/>
                <p>
                Looking back at my notes from that day, something that stands out to me is the list of social factors that are changing modern engineering: 
                  <li>independent contractor engineers vs. working at large firms</li> 
                  <li>managerial engineer vs. practicing engineer</li>
                  <li>increased complexity of products requires increased funding of research</li>
                  <li>(the above factor results in) rising financial stakes</li>
                </p>
                I had never really thought about engineering in this way, and it was definitely quite eye-opening. I left this lecture with a furthered interest in engineering
                ethics and looking forward to coming back on thursday.

                During this second lecture, we started diving deeper into concrete ethics concepts, more specifically the definition of ethics and how codes of conducts
                reflect ethical values of different groups of people and organizations. This lecture was particularly memorable because it was when my first lecture group 
                started to get to know each other well (we all learned each other's names and majors and introduced 1 new group member). In addition to that, this is the 
                lecture when we started asking a lot of questions and working together quite a bit in our group. The specific focus of this lecture was Codes of Ethics.
                Some of the questions my group thought about: "How do different professional societies come up with their codes of conduct/ethics?", "What happens when
                someone violates the code of conduct of a society they're part of?", and "What if you're in 2 different societies with conflicting codes of ethics?". These 
                questions combined with the activity we had during lecture gave me some deeper insight into how different organizations write their codes of conduct and how 
                these codes reflect their values.

                Below, I've included the IEEE Code of Conduct and a picture from my internship, where I worked as a IT intern in a coporate environment. Codes of Ethics are 
                particularly important in corporate environments like the one I worked at (especially since the company I worked for was responsible for most of the infrastructure
                powering the U.S.'s financial markets).

                The two biggest takeaways I had from this lecture were the "seeing with fresh eyes" activity and the listening "ladder" (phases of listening). The "seeing with
                fresh eyes" activity had us work in partners to prounounce random words in different ways. We were supposed to say the first word that came to mind after hearing
                the other person's word, and pronouncing it as if we were "chewing", "extending", and "puncing" the word. This activity really had me actively think about how
                I pronounce words and how other people pronounce words. The listening ladder helped me understand the different levels of listening, and how getting better at
                all these levels of will help you get better at really comprehending the information that other people are trying to convey. This lecture also had me think about
                which phase of listening I engaged in the most, and in which situations I engage different levels of listening.

                This lecture's topics of privacy, information security, and algorithmic bias. Since I am a computer science major, these topics are pretty important and significant
                in my career. If I end up chosing a career path in software engineering, I may end up writing algorithms that deal with huge amounts of user data. It'll be important
                for me to have ethical concerns in mind when dealing with these issues when designing applications that deal with a lot of data. Something in particular that I found
                interesting from the material of this lecture is the idea that algorithms can have bias that wasn't intended by the designers of the programs. Since machine learning 
                algorithms aren't directly written by humans and instead "learn" by processing huge amounts of data, these algorithms can be affected by the quality of the data that 
                they're fed. If the data that these algorithms are given is not truly representative of the population that ends up getting affected by these algorithms, there could 
                be ethical issues that arise as a result of this potential "algorithmic bias". Overall, I found this lecture really interesting as it was intreguing to learn about 
                ethical concerns in computer science.

                During this lecture, we really emphasized the importance of building design capabilities. We talked about the design capabilities worksheet (referenced
                in works cited) and how important it is that engineers are well-rounded. I actually really liked this discussion, because personally I really agree with
                the idea that engineers should work on being well-rounded people. Although most engineers are quite proficient in analytical and mathematical thinking, something
                that engineers often struggle with other communication and creative skills. The design skills worksheet includes 8 design abilities: "design your design work",
                "communicate deliberately", "navigate ambiguity", "move between concrete and abstract", "build and craft intentionally", "experiment rapidly", "synthesize
                information", and "learn from others". If an engineer can manage to improve their abilities in all of these areas, they can really be even more effective
                in their jobs.

                Lecture 6 focused on media intelligence: "practices that allow people to access, critically evaluate, and create or manipulate media". This was also the same
                week when we had the podcast episode assigned in place of one of our regular RR assignments. This was the class's first introduction to the concept of a person's 
                "filter bubble", and how we often isolate ourselves from other people's perspectives in our own filter bubble. This means that we intentionally surround ourselves
                with information that fits our own opinions. For me, the real takeaway from this lecture was the concept of storytelling, and how important it is. We learned about
                the spine of a story and how there are specific parts that help build a story:
                <ol>
                  <li>Once upon a time... (setup)</li>
                  <li>Every day... (background)</li>
                  <li>But one day... (plot twist)</li>
                  <li>Because of that... (result --> times as many times as necessary)</li>
                  <li>Until, finally... (conclusion)</li>
                </ol>
                This structure of storytelling is something that I've never thought about before, and it gave me a better understanding of how I can make my own stories more 
                effective at conveying information. Overall, this lecture made me feel pretty good about the concepts of listening and storytelling, and also how they connect
                with ethics in engineering.

                This lecture was the last lecture that I spent working with my first lecture group, which was definitely a bittersweet moment. The most memorable part of the 
                class was the metaphor activity, where each group was asked to think of a metaphor that represents how their group works as a unit. The metaphor that my group
                came up with is a "Brick Wall". Some reasons for why our group was a big wall:
                <ul>
                  <li>Each of us is a brick and we build upon one another</li>
                  <li>We're stronger together</li>
                  <li>We get better over time as the bricks come together</li>
                  <li>We BUILD upon each others ideas</li>
                  <li>We're not as strong on our own</li>
                </ul>
                I think the metaphor was definitely a great way to describe our dynamic as a group. Hiteesh, Zihan, Gabe, Kieran and I had some great conversations about ethics 
                engineering over the course of the four weeks that we were together as a group. Like I said at the beggining, it was a bittersweet moment for all of us; we were
                definitely upset that we wouldn't be working together, but were hopeful for what was in our future.

                This was definitely an interesting lecture because of the way that it tied together many of the concepts that we learned about earlier in the semester. For this 
                specific lecture, we paired up with a random partner, so I got to meet someone new and get a different perspective/opinion on the topics we've been learning in
                class. Some of the concepts we talked about were: 
                <ul>
                  <li>Soft skills: we shouldn't actually call them "soft"</li>
                  <li>They won't be treated as seriously/be considered important to improve</li>
                  <li>They CAN be learned</li>
                  <li>"Ethics are aboue relationships" - Dr. Mogul</li>
                  <li>Soft skills are critical to ethical thinking & the practice of engineering</li>
                </ul>
                Later in the lecture, we tied together some concepts we learned about earlier, talking about the difference between ethics and morals, ethical issues with
                algorithmic bias, and a TED talk about human moral evolution over time. I really enjoyed how sweetly this lecture tied all of these concepts together,
                and it was nice how I got to meet a new classmate and work with them (even if it was only for one lecture).

                This lecture was the first lecture that I got to meet my new lecture group (which I'm guessing will be my group for the rest of the semester) and started to
                get to know them. I learned their names, the pronunciation of their names, their pronouns, majors, and some other miscellaneous stuff about them. I found out
                that I actually have a lot in common with some of them. We also all shared our social media accounts with each other and formed a snapchat group for better 
                communication. Kevin and I are both Bitcamp organizers; Brian and I are both TAs in the Computer Science department;
                Jess and I are both involved in Technica. The actual course material covered was pretty interesting: we talked about different ethical theories and how they
                can be used to analyze ethical situations. Utilitarianism, Deontology, and Virtue Ethics and how these different theories relate to each other. Overall, a 
                memorable lecture.

                The main focus of this lecture was culture and how it relates to engineering ethics. One interactive activity that we did during class had us think about 
                where we would say we're from based on where we're located. My answers changed quite a bit as the locations changed, but the overall trend was that I changed
                where I said I was from to be more and more specific as the location became closer and closer to where I live. This introduced the concept of situational
                awareness: the idea that context matter in how we behave and since different people and different places have different knowledge bases, so you have to speak
                in a certain way so you have a mutual understanding.

                This was the last lecture before we left for spring break, and unfortunately the last in-person lecture that we had this semester. There was definitely a
                weird mood going on between the students especially at the beginning, as we were discussing how school would change as a result of going online. This was also
                the day after I had to stay up a bit late because I was working with the Bitcamp directing team regarding what actions we would take in response to the COVID-19 
                pandemic (we ended up cancelling the event, something that happened to most in-person events for the rest of the spring semester). I was definitely feeling a bit
                down at first, but then I really ended up enjoying the guest speaker we had that day: Adith Thummalapali (I think I spelled that right). Adith talked about
                accessibility issues on UMD's campus and the Accessibility report that he published along with ADS. I think it was really inspirational to hear his story about
                how he worked hard to make the university body more aware of what kinds of issues with accessibility exist on campus. He also related it really well with the 
                problem solving and design that we do as engineers, and made me think deeper about how I go about solving engineering issues. I came out of this lecture with 
                a lot of motivation and enthusiasm because of his invigorating presentation.

                Although this isn't really related to ENEE200, I take a quick second to recognize the fact that transitioning to online learning in such an abrupt way was
                definitely a difficult adjustment on many people, students and professors alike. I'm glad that the university is having a P/F grading policy this semester,
                it was a really great move by the school to recognize the kinds of struggles that many students may be having now. I'm hoping that everyone stays safe and healthy
                as a result of quarantining and social distancing: we'll surely get through this together. The main activity from this week was a collaborative exercise in examining
                the accessibility of the ELMS course website for ENEE200, continuing the ideas we were talking about before we went on break. This was definitely a fun activity as
                it was nice to work with my lecture group again and it definitely gave me a different perspective on how websites can be designed with accessibility in mind. I applied
                some of the things I learned about accessibility of websites to the design of this website, which I think is pretty cool.
                <br/><br/>
                I think the online activities of week 2 were a good sign of what's to come. Although these online activities definitely aren't the same experience that we get
                from in-person lecture in this course, I'm still looking forward to how ENEE200 will continue online for the rest of the semester. This was a difficult week for 
                me because of the transition to online learning. I was just starting to adjust my schedule and figure out how to manage my time. Online learning is a completely different 
                experience and environment from what an in-person education is like. I had to spend some time figuring out what the best way is to proceed with my classes, including this
                class. The activities from this week were definitely interesting and it was nice to see how we still have the opportunity to work with out groups for the rest of the semester
                on various different tasks and challenges.

                The framework that we reviewed this week was the concept of "whistleblowers". A whistleblower is someone (usually an employee or member of an organization) that exposes
                a wrongdoing by a company or organization to the government/relevant law enforcement agencies. <i>"Whistleblowers play a hugely important role in countering the worst corporate
                and government excesses. "<b>- Damon Poeter</b></i> Protecting whistleblowers is a crucial step to ensuring that companies, organizations, and even government agencies don't make 
                unethical decisions. Something that was covered in this lecture was engineers and their role in whistleblowing. Before we left campus, we watched a video about Edward Snowden,
                an analyst that worked in the NSA for many years, and how he came out with information about how the NSA was spying on regular people and abusing their intelligence sources. Edward
                Snowden is just once example of how engineers can "blow the whistle" on wrongdoing at the companies they work for. In the powerpoint, we reviewed how engineers are often pressured
                by the organizations they work for which means they are reluctant to become a whistleblower when an ethical dilemma actually does arise. I think something especially important to
                think about is how much responsibility engineers should take on in terms of speaking up against negative behavior by their companies. Personally, I believe that company employees
                should try to work out the problem from within the organization first, but if their complaints are not acted upon, engineers have an ethical responsibility to blow the whistle
                and expose these issues publically. People have been hurt and have even died in accidents that have resulted from unethical practices by companies where engineers failed to 
                speak up. Although engineers should always work to innovate and make the world a better place through problem solving, engineers are also responsible for ensuring the safety
                of the users of their products.
                <br/><br/>
                The big activity that we worked on this week was the whistleblowing storyboard. Here is the storyboard that I came up with:

                <!-- Insert image of my whistleblowing storyboard -->
                <div class="row" style="margin-top:2%; margin-bottom:2%;">
                  <div class="col-md-11 offset-md-1"><img width="90%" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid" src="assets/images/whistleblowing_storyboard.png" alt="My whisteblowing storyboard about Christopher Meili."/></div>
                </div>       

                For the storyboard, we were tasked with researching a whistleblower and describing their story visually in the form of a grid of pictures. The whistleblower I chose to research 
                and write about was Christopher Meili. Christopher Meili was a security guard that worked at the Swiss bank UBS. One night, he discovered that the company was destroying evidence
                of Jewish inherited property and assets (likely so that the bank could acquire the assets for themselves). Meili reported this to the proper authority and UBS eventually had to
                settle with several Jewish organizations representing the families of those affected. Meili received a large cash reward and political asylum in the U.S. Completing the story board
                was an interesting activty and I definitely enjoyed getting my creative juices flowing a little bit (although I'm a terrible artist).

                The two main activities for this week were finishing off the Contemporary Ethical Case and a discussion about the Cassandra Coefficient for Fukushima Daiichi.
                The conclusion of my contemporary ethical case was exciting and a nice feeling because I was able to conclude the case and finally put my work into an entertaining format (with 
                the recorded pecha kucha presentation). The conclusion of the ethical case with CEC4 and 5 definitely was a lot of work, but it felt rewarding not only because I got a nice end result,
                but also because the case I chose (the recent extensions of Nuclear Power Plant licenses in the U.S.) was really interesting and it was nice to be able to present my opinion on the 
                case (lessons learned, ethical takeways).

                The discussion on the Cassandra Coefficient was interesting because I enjoyed working with my new discussion group to complete the activity. I learned a lot about the different
                parts that make up the calculation of the Cassandra Coefficient, as well ass learning about the disaster that went down at Fukushima Daiichi. I was responsible for researching 
                who the decision makers were in the situation, and what went wrong to result in the catastrophic failure to contain a nuclear meltdown. Some of the issues that happened with the 
                decision makers were diffusion of responsibility, agenda intertia, and complexity mismatch. Most of the people to blame where the management, and corruption within nuclear power
                regulators in Japan. Reading about what happened in Japan was definitely a bit frustrating, seeing how there were so many people that could of stepped forward to make sure that issues
                with the flood walls at the plant were handled, and there were even engineers that showed proof that the plant wouldn't withstand a big tsunami.

                The Challenger case was an intreguing one to both read and write about. In addition to our reading, we were also assigned to watch a short New York Times video that described
                the catastrophe and the events that led to it. The Challenger case was another example of how engineers speak up about potential problems, but they are shut down by management
                who prioritize cost-saving and meeting deadlines. The Challenger lift-off had already been delayed multiple times and NASA put a lot of pressure on the contractor who was responsible
                for the safety issue to allow the launch to happen (even though engineers at MTI had calculations that showed that it was too cold for the shuttle to safely launch that day). It was
                truly a tragedy and it devastated many people. I was a bit emotional when I was watching the video and reading about the case, hearing about the civilian school teacher who died that
                day, as well as my anger towards the management figures, both at NASA and at MTI, that allowed for this to happen.

                This was also the same week that we worked with our filter buddies to burst each other's bubbles. The filter bubble activity was an interesting one (and a part of this ethics portfolio
                so you can <a href="#filterbubble">check it out</a>). Working with my filter buddy, Amy, was fun because I got to know someone who I only talked to a few times before the semester
                ended. Sharing my own filter bubble and learning about Amy's was cool because it was interesting to compare how different the content we consume is based on our personal interests.
                This was definitely one of my favorite online assignments so far, and I hope you enjoy the filter bubble section of my portfolio, where you can get some more details about the activity
                and my own filter bubble.

                The second to last week of online learning had two main activities: "RR Chapter 5" and two lecture cards that involved sociotechnical system drivers and using them to analyze
                the ethics of an object. For the McGinn reading, it was more or less a conclusion of all of the topics that we've read about throughout the duration of ENEE200, and the assignment was
                to write about the topics that we found to be the most impactful and important. Although there was a lot of cases that I learned about and a lot of different ethical concepts we learned
                about, only choosing a few of them to write about from the variety of cases was definitely difficult. Two of the sections I chose to write about in my assignment were "codes of ethics" and 
                "the ethics and sociology of engineering". I think both of these were the most important topics that we discussed in the course, and probably my biggest takeways out of everything I've
                learned. Codes of ethics are a great example of how professional organizations can determine standards that they want their members to follow, encouraging ethical behaviors from their members.
                <br/><br/>
                Thinking about the ethics of an object was an interesting activity and it definitely made me think outside the box. I never really spent time to examine the objects in my trash/recycling 
                and think about their meaning in my life and society as a whole. Using sociotechnical system drivers to analyze the technological impact of the product (in my case, packaging from dried
                mangoes) and thinking about the way they were produced and the environmental impact the object required some creative thinking and writing. Dr. Mogul also had us complete the activity on
                paper first, which was engaging and a nice break from all the work I've been doing on my computer.

                <b>Our first activity this week was public infrastructure and corruption (Lecture Card 17).</b><br/>
                <p>The topic that I looked into from opensecrets.org was "Dark Money": the idea that there exist sources of political spending that do not disclose donors. 
                Even though there are regulations in place that require politicians running for office to disclose all of their donors, 
                some people have found ways to get around it through political non-profits and super PACs accepting money from these non-profits and other shell corporations.
                </p>
                <p>These "dark money" groups account for a lot of the untracked funding in political campaigns that escapes the regulations of the FEC (the Federal Election 
                Commission). Another method that political organizations use to escape regulations is "soft money", where political organizations not officially associated 
                with a candidate's campaign, indirectly spend money to benefit the campaign. <br/>Hearing about how political candidates can use these methods to influence elections 
                definitely made me feel a bit frustrated and upset. I think that the U.S. was founded on the ideals of democracy and a fair government where everyone's voice is 
                heard. When we have unfair sources of money in elections, like what is being done with the introduction of "dark money" and "soft money" in modern political 
                campaigns, we see some of the founding principles of our countries being violated.</p>
                <b>The second activity of the week was "LC19: Infrastructure and Civic Engagement".</b> <br/>
                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who Represents You?</span></p>
                <p>President Trump, Governor Phil Murphy, Senator Cory Booker, Senator Bob Menendez, House of Representatives Rep for my district, Mayor of West Orange, City councilmen, and the State assembly.</p>
                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What do you notices? What surprises you?</span></p>
                <p>I completely forgot about my county representatives. There were actually quite a few listed for my address, I just never really realized that on a local government level, counties have a lot of power and have a lot of representation for their constituents.</p>
                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Maryland General Assembly Legislation</span></p>
                <p>One bill I noticed in the archive was introduced in Maryland GA's House on March 11th. This bill (HB1472) was arguing for prohibiting the mayor and city council of Baltimore City from limiting the installation of solar panels on commercial and residential structures. I found it particularly interesting because I think clean energy sources like solar power are really important and I'm surprised that laws like this even need to be put into place.</p>
                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What, if any, educational background fo you desire for the people that represent you?</span></p>
                <p>I definitely would prefer someone with an engineering/scientific education background to represent me because I believe that people with this kind of background are more likely to think critically about the lawmaking process and take into account scientific studies and data when making important decisions affecting residents they represent.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center"><b>Interview Reflection:</b></h3>

            <p>
              Both the listening ladder and the levels of listening concepts are great tools for self-reflecting on our communication habits. We talk to other people every single day, about ourselves
              and whats going on in our lives, about the news and other random topics, but we rarely take a moment to reflect on how we really listen to what others are saying. When we first went over the
              listening ladder, something that I noticed in particular was how different levels of the ladder put different focus on how much the listener was focusing on understanding the listener 
              and the meaning of the message they're trying to put across. We can see a similar theme with the <a href="https://www.livingroomconversations.org/what-is-your-level-of-listening/">"levels of listening"</a>.
              Reflecting on my interview with my friend Teo, something I noticed was that even though I was aware of the fact that I should be trying to be an active listener and try to understand what
              my interviewee was explaining, I kept on spending time thinking about the next question I was going to ask, before he even finished talking. Although I was trying to "become curious about the other and
              open to new perspectives" as listening level 2 describes, I wasn't full engaged in just trying to appreciate what he was saying. I definitely felt comfortable talking to him and asking personal questions,
              nut I felt like I wasn't completely involved as I was intermittently taking notes, and not putting my full focus onto listening and understanding the stories he was telling.
              Listening is a skill that can be developed just like any other skill, and I think the next step for me to improve that skill is working to be a more active and empathetic listener. Rather than just
              trying to absorb the information I'm hearing, I need to work to understand what is being said and be more aware of the context and emotional meaning of the conversation. Not only did this interview
              activity help me reflect more on my conversational and listening skills, but it also allowed me to get a deeper understanding about what motivates one of my closest friends.
            </p>

            <p>
              The person I chose to interview for this assignment was one of my best-friends, Teo Nys. Teo and I have been friends since elementary school, and we've spent a lot of time getting to know 
              each other really well over the years. I tried to set up the interview from the start as if I didn't know him, asking more general questions that someone would probably get from a recruiter
              at a job interview, but then I led into slightly more personal questions by diving deeper on some of the main things Teo revealed about himself while introducing himself. One of the themes 
              that was recurring throughout our conversation was the idea of culture and identity: how much of an impact culture has on our identity. Teo brought up his German and Russian ancestry (Russian father
              and a German mother), and how he thinks that some of his personal values are closely related to his european origins. Teo explained how he prioritizes quality over quantity in his personal relationships;
              he believes that his upbringing has resulted in him valuing building stronger ties with his close circle of friends. To quote Teo directly: "I don't seek that constant attention and validation
              from others. I like to spend time with my close friends." Another topic that came up was the idea of "soft" and "hard/technical" skills. Since we discussed this in lecture quite a bit and this
              activity has a particular focus on an important soft skill, I consider it to be one of the most important things we talked about during the interview. Teo brought up the idea that 
              people should work towards having a good balance of soft skills and technical skills and that technical skills aren't useful when you don't have the soft skills that allow you to take 
              advantage of those technical skills in a collaborative context. I fully agree with this, and I think that ENEE200 has made me more cognizant of the soft skills that I need to work on improving 
              in the future. Overall, I noticed myself thinking a lot about ENEE200 throughout the course of this interview, connecting topics we talked about with concepts learned in class (and not just ethics
              concepts, but also our discussions about being a well-rounded engineer).

              Here's a link to my Personal Code of Engineering Ethics: <a href="assets/Pomytkin_PersonalCode.pdf" download>Pomytkin_PersonalCode.pdf</a><br/><br/>

              One of the first activities that we did during one of the earlier lectures in this course was a discussion on professional codes of ethics/conduct. We worked in our lecture groups to research 
              different professional organizations' codes of ethics and compare and contrast them. Something I noticed in particular was that most codes of ethics between different organizations shared a few
              things in common: they all described the ethical guidelines that a professional is expected to follow in their field of work. Since different professions can have very different ethical situations arise,
              codes of ethics should define boundaries that must not be crossed on the job. 
            </p>

            Although the final Ethics Portfolio assignment is due this Tuesday, I do want to spend a bit of time to reflect on the semester and what I'm taking away from this class.
            Last week I completed the final McGinn reading assignment, writing a letter to President Pines about how we should change the engineering curriculum at UMD to train 
            ethically responsible engineers. Here is a download link to my answers to that assignment: <a href="assets/Assignment 10 - RR. McGinn Ch 6 and 7 Conclusion.pdf" download>RR. McGinn Ch 6 and 7 Conclusion</a>.
            <br/><br/>
            It was definitely a bittersweet moment, as I was coming to terms with the fact that this semester is coming to a close. Before we left campus, I had a ton of fun, both outside
            and inside the classroom. Although COVID-19 forced all of us to leave campus and limit our in-person social interaction, I started to adjust to the situation and build my own routine
            at home. I've really gotten used to online learning and have enjoyed the conclusion to my semester. ENEE200 was a fantastic class that I initially took as an elective to fulfill some 
            of my Gen-ed requirements, but it really turned into a class that made me think differently and exposed me to new perspectives. I find myself applying the concepts I learned in this course
            when reading the news and even in random situations in my life. This class has also resulted in me getting to know a lot of new people of different backgrounds and making some new friends;
            I look forward to keeping up with these connections and getting to know them even better when we get back to school.
