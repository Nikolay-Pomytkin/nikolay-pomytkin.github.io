              <b>What’s the most fun thing you’ve done so far this year?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the winter break, I went to Texas to visit my older sister (who lives/works in Austin) and we went on
              a road trip exploring different parts of Texas and New Mexico. I think one of the best (and most fun) parts
              of that experience was visiting the Carlsbad caverns (in NM). The Carlsbad Caverns are really complex, featuring
              over 100 different caves, and it was really interesting to see the kinds of ancient formations that you can see throughout
              the caves (stalactites and stalagmites). 
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Can you describe a time when you worked your hardest? What happened?</b>

            <p>
              HackRU Spring 2019: <br/>
              2 of my friends and I formed a group to work on a health-focused project. When we first started out, we weren't 
              really sure about what exactly we would make, but as we brainstormed some ideas as a group, we figured out an idea that
              we all wanted to work on. Throughout the course of the 24 hour event, the three of us worked really hard to get a working prototype.
              All 3 of us built upon each other's strengths, splitting up the work by figuring out who was the most experienced with certain 
              technologies and worked to bring different parts of the project together. In the end, we had a working project that ended up getting 
              the overall 1st place, as well as the "Best AI/ML Hack" superlative. Although we didn't get too much sleep and it definitely took a toll
              on us, it felt really good to have our hard work rewarded with a prize, and to make such a technically-complicated project.

              <b>What issues or ideas make your heart beat faster, whether because you are so deeply compelled by them, because you are angered by them, or because you are overjoyed by them?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the issues that I'm really passionate/concerned about is the rise of automation and the growing wealth gap in the United States. In recent years,
              there has been a trend of replacing certain blue collar work with robotic machinery. Employment in the U.S. manufacturing industry has gone down consistently
              over the past decade, as well as in retail. Working class people are losing their jobs. Wage growth is stagnating. Many families can't afford to pay
              an unexpected bill. While all this happens, the 1% continue to grow their wealth. Despite America being one of the wealthiest countries in the world,
              our poverty levels are equal to or above many other developed nations. In 2019, the top 20% of families earned 52% of the nation's income, almost 10% more than
              in 1960 (43%) <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/02/07/6-facts-about-economic-inequality-in-the-u-s/">(Schaeffer)</a>. We must start to think about what kinds of sweeping policies could help reverse
              this trend and help reduce the stark income inequality in our nation.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>What do you enjoy talking to people about?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              There's a lot of different topics that I like to talk to people about. Often, I try to find something that we share in common and focus on that during a 
              conversation. Sometimes that leads to a deep conversation on one specific topic, which really helps build a connection with the other person. Also, I often 
              find myself talking to people about music, movies, TV shows, hobbies, and other things that people often define their identity by. 
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
              <b>What would your friends ask for your help on?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              A lot of the time it is school or career related, but I find that my closest friends ask me for help regarding personal issues that they face in their lives (that's
              how you can really tell the difference between your closest friends and just "people in your friend group"). Sometimes when a friend asks me for help on an issue 
              like that, all they're looking for is support and encouragement, but at other times they're really looking for support. It is important to be able to make the 
              distinction between those two and properly address your friends needs. You have to be there for your friends when they need you, so that they'll be there for you
              when you need them.

                This was actually the first lecture of ENEE200 that I attended, since I joined the class late off of the waitlist. For me, this lecture was a great intro to 
                the course. I remember what happened during this lecture pretty clearly, even when writing about it weeks later. I remember it being a bit awkward at first, because
                I wasn't sure what lecture group I was in. For the first few minutes of lecture I aimlessly walked around trying to figure out what group I was supposed to be with,
                until finally approaching Dr. Mogul and getting placed with the group that I ended up working with for the first quarter of the semester. We were introduced to the first
                ethical framework of the semester: ABET and "the Good Engineer". This was my first introduction to the idea of ethical frameworks in this class, and it was genuinely
                the first example (of many throughout the course) of concepts that change the way I thought about engineering. 
                <br/> <br/>
                <p>
                Looking back at my notes from that day, something that stands out to me is the list of social factors that are changing modern engineering: 
                  <li>independent contractor engineers vs. working at large firms</li> 
                  <li>managerial engineer vs. practicing engineer</li>
                  <li>increased complexity of products requires increased funding of research</li>
                  <li>(the above factor results in) rising financial stakes</li>
                </p>
                I had never really thought about engineering in this way, and it was definitely quite eye-opening. I left this lecture with a furthered interest in engineering
                ethics and looking forward to coming back on thursday.

                During this second lecture, we started diving deeper into concrete ethics concepts, more specifically the definition of ethics and how codes of conducts
                reflect ethical values of different groups of people and organizations. This lecture was particularly memorable because it was when my first lecture group 
                started to get to know each other well (we all learned each other's names and majors and introduced 1 new group member). In addition to that, this is the 
                lecture when we started asking a lot of questions and working together quite a bit in our group. The specific focus of this lecture was Codes of Ethics.
                Some of the questions my group thought about: "How do different professional societies come up with their codes of conduct/ethics?", "What happens when
                someone violates the code of conduct of a society they're part of?", and "What if you're in 2 different societies with conflicting codes of ethics?". These 
                questions combined with the activity we had during lecture gave me some deeper insight into how different organizations write their codes of conduct and how 
                these codes reflect their values.

                The two biggest takeaways I had from this lecture were the "seeing with fresh eyes" activity and the listening "ladder" (phases of listening). The "seeing with
                fresh eyes" activity had us work in partners to prounounce random words in different ways. We were supposed to say the first word that came to mind after hearing
                the other person's word, and pronouncing it as if we were "chewing", "extending", and "puncing" the word. This activity really had me actively think about how
                I pronounce words and how other people pronounce words. The listening ladder helped me understand the different levels of listening, and how getting better at
                all these levels of will help you get better at really comprehending the information that other people are trying to convey. This lecture also had me think about
                which phase of listening I engaged in the most, and in which situations I engage different levels of listening.

                This lecture's topics of privacy, information security, and algorithmic bias. Since I am a computer science major, these topics are pretty important and significant
                in my career. If I end up chosing a career path in software engineering, I may end up writing algorithms that deal with huge amounts of user data. It'll be important
                for me to have ethical concerns in mind when dealing with these issues when designing applications that deal with a lot of data. Something in particular that I found
                interesting from the material of this lecture is the idea that algorithms can have bias that wasn't intended by the designers of the programs. Since machine learning 
                algorithms aren't directly written by humans and instead "learn" by processing huge amounts of data, these algorithms can be affected by the quality of the data that 
                they're fed. If the data that these algorithms are given is not truly representative of the population that ends up getting affected by these algorithms, there could 
                be ethical issues that arise as a result of this potential "algorithmic bias". Overall, I found this lecture really interesting as it was intreguing to learn about 
                ethical concerns in computer science.

                During this lecture, we really emphasized the importance of building design capabilities. We talked about the design capabilities worksheet (referenced
                in works cited) and how important it is that engineers are well-rounded. I actually really liked this discussion, because personally I really agree with
                the idea that engineers should work on being well-rounded people. Although most engineers are quite proficient in analytical and mathematical thinking, something
                that engineers often struggle with other communication and creative skills. The design skills worksheet includes 8 design abilities: "design your design work",
                "communicate deliberately", "navigate ambiguity", "move between concrete and abstract", "build and craft intentionally", "experiment rapidly", "synthesize
                information", and "learn from others". If an engineer can manage to improve their abilities in all of these areas, they can really be even more effective
                in their jobs.

                Lecture 6 focused on media intelligence: "practices that allow people to access, critically evaluate, and create or manipulate media". This was also the same
                week when we had the podcast episode assigned in place of one of our regular RR assignments. This was the class's first introductino to the concept of a person's 
                "filter bubble", and how we often isolate ourselves from other people's perspectives in our own filter bubble. This means that we intentionally surround ourselves
                with information that fits our own opinions. For me, the real takeaway from this lecture was the concept of storytelling, and how important it is. We learned about
                the spine of a story and how there are specific parts that help build a story:
                <ol>
                  <li>Once upon a time... (setup)</li>
                  <li>Every day... (background)</li>
                  <li>But one day... (plot twist)</li>
                  <li>Because of that... (result --> times as many times as necessary)</li>
                  <li>Until, finally... (conclusion)</li>
                </ol>
                This structure of storytelling is something that I've never thought about before, and it gave me a better understanding of how I can make my own stories more 
                effective at conveying information. Overall, this lecture made me feel pretty good about the concepts of listening and storytelling, and also how they connect
                with ethics in engineering.

                This lecture was the last lecture that I spent working with my first lecture group, which was definitely a bittersweet moment. The most memorable part of the 
                class was the metaphor activity, where each group was asked to think of a metaphor that represents how their group works as a unit. The metaphor that my group
                came up with is a "Brick Wall". Some reasons for why our group was a big wall:
                <ul>
                  <li>Each of us is a brick and we build upon one another</li>
                  <li>We're stronger together</li>
                  <li>We get better over time as the bricks come together</li>
                  <li>We BUILD upon each others ideas</li>
                  <li>We're not as strong on our own</li>
                </ul>
                I think the metaphor was definitely a great way to describe our dynamic as a group. Hiteesh, Zihan, Gabe, Kieran and I had some great conversations about ethics 
                engineering over the course of the four weeks that we were together as a group. Like I said at the beggining, it was a bittersweet moment for all of us; we were
                definitely upset that we wouldn't be working together, but were hopeful for what was in our future.

                This was definitely an interesting lecture because of the way that it tied together many of the concepts that we learned about earlier in the semester. For this 
                specific lecture, we paired up with a random partner, so I got to meet someone new and get a different perspective/opinion on the topics we've been learning in
                class. Some of the concepts we talked about were: 
                <ul>
                  <li>Soft skills: we shouldn't actually call them "soft"</li>
                  <li>They won't be treated as seriously/be considered important to improve</li>
                  <li>They CAN be learned</li>
                  <li>"Ethics are aboue relationships" - Dr. Mogul</li>
                  <li>Soft skills are critical to ethical thinking & the practice of engineering</li>
                </ul>
                Later in the lecture, we tied together some concepts we learned about earlier, talking about the difference between ethics and morals, ethical issues with
                algorithmic bias, and a TED talk about human moral evolution over time. I really enjoyed how sweetly this lecture tied all of these concepts together,
                and it was nice how I got to meet a new classmate and work with them (even if it was only for one lecture).

                get to know them. I learned their names, the pronunciation of their names, their pronouns, majors, and some other miscellaneous stuff about them. I found out
                that I actually have a lot in common with some of them. Kevin and I are both Bitcamp organizers; Brian and I are both TAs in the Computer Science department;
                Jess and I are both involved in Technica. The actual course material covered was pretty interesting: we talked about different ethical theories and how they
                can be used to analyze ethical situations. Utilitarianism, Deontology, and Virtue Ethics and how these different theories relate to each other. Overall, a 
                memorable lecture.
