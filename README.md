## Portfolio website

This is a repository for my portfolio website that is available at [nikolay.pomytkin.com](https://nikolay.pomytkin.com)

This site was redesigned using Twitter's Bootstrap Framework in Dec2018/Jan2019. It includes a carousel with 3 slides,
each containing an important part of my portfolio.

This site is being redesigned for the 2019-2020 school year with a brand new single page design. The development version of the new redesign is available in the 2019_development folder.
